# 💰 Expense Tracker CLI

A simple and interactive Command Line Interface (CLI) tool built with Python to help users manage and track their daily expenses. The application allows you to add, update, delete, and view expenses with monthly summaries and category-wise filtering.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add new expenses with amount, category, and description
- 📝 Update or delete existing expenses
- 📅 View expenses by date or month
- 📊 Monthly summaries with total and category-wise breakdown
- 🎯 Set and monitor monthly budgets
- 💾 Data is saved locally using JSON (no external database needed)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- JSON for local data storage
- `os` and `datetime` modules for file management and date handling
- Simple CLI interface using built-in `input()` prompts

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/expense-tracker-cli.git
cd expense-tracker-cli
python expense_tracker.py
```

> Make sure Python is installed and added to your system’s PATH.

## 💡 How to Use

Run the script using Python, then follow the prompts:

```
Welcome to Expense Tracker CLI

## 📘 What I Learned

While building this project, I practiced real-world use of Python file handling, JSON data storage, date manipulation, and creating user-friendly terminal interfaces. I enjoyed building the monthly summary and budget features the most, as they made the tool feel practical and helpful for everyday use.
